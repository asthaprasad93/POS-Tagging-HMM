I ' m a little teapot
Short and stout
Here is my handle
Here is my spout
When I get all steamed up
I just shout
Tip me over and pour me out

I am a very special pot
It is true
Here is an example of what I can do
I can turn my handle into a spout
Tip me over and pour me out

[Chorus]
I ' m a little teapot
Short and stout
Here is my handle
Here is my spout
When I get all steamed up
I just shout
Tip me over and pour me out

I am a very special pot
It is true
Here is an example of what I can do
I can turn my handle into a spout
Tip me over and pour me out
